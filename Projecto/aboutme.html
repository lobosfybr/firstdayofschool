            <p>A good challenge is a commodity that I cannot  ignore. Striving to improve everyday has carried me through life’s adversities with grace. Jumping from cap and gown to a bus full of unfamiliar faces headed for boot camp was a real wake-up call. Nothing like waking up at 4 o’clock in the morning everyday for 8 weeks to relay a daunting message: nothing worth having in life comes easy. I took that to heart. That subtle lesson pushed me to become one of the most qualified members at one of the most elite units in the service, where I accumulated over 3000kg of cocaine seizures in 3 short years. The same premise lead me to perform amongst the top 10 real estate sales agents in the country for a new home construction company after an honorable discharge from Uncle Sam. So, why stop doing what I’m already good at? The answer is simple. A good challenge is a commodity that I cannot  ignore. And what greater challenge for someone not so technologically inclined than to gain proficiency in computer programming? After all, if one day wars will be fought by robots and homes will be sold online via virtual reality, we all ought to get comfortable with the language of the future: code. </p>
