        <em>Just kidding</em>
    </h3>

    <p>
        Over the years, countless curious souls have asked me to introduce myself. In the past, I may have responded with some superficial details about myself. Which, if we're being honest, no one <em>really</em> cares about. You know what I'm talking about. "Hi my name is _______, I'm ___ years old and I'm from _______". A generic formality we've all shamefully partaken in. And for what? Am I really supposed to remember how many cats Susan had? I don't even remember what I had for breakfast! <strong><em>NO M√ÅS!</em></strong>
    </p>

        To be clear, I'm not saying we don't care about each other. That isn't true. <em>We should share</em>. <em>We should connect</em>. We should do so in a deep and meaningful way. You don't want to know what my favorite color is or my zodiac sign. If you want to know about me at all, you want to hear the interesting. You want the juice, the meat and potatoes. Heck, you want to be entertained! Well, rejoice, my friend. Eywa has heard you. And this page is made special, <em>just for you</em>.

        <em>Who is Kenny Cruz?</em>
    </h2>

    <p>
        Who knows? I sure don't. How about I tell you the "what" rather than the deeper, far too philisophical for a painfully-amateur bio page, "who." I'm a 25 year-old pursuing a career in programming. Particular interest? Blockchain. But we'll get to that later. Orlando has treated me nicely since I moved in 2018. I immidiately began my career as a real estate agent and fared pretty well. Prior to all of that, I was a door-kicking, drug-busting hothead in the military. Joined right out of high school, I enjoyed (or endured) 4 years before an honorable discharge <!--dropped me off in the vacation capital of the world-->. Now I've set my sights on coding.

        <!--in lieu of a weak attempt at everytime, I produce an awkward, stutter-rich attempt at explaining who I am, which never really works out for anyone. precious breath to give an introduction I've given too many times. So, in lieu of an awkward, stutter-rich attempt to share who I am, please enjoy this page made just for you.</p>
